# Power-BI-Dashboard

## Overview
This project aimed to visualise large data sets relating to Global Land Temperature. It involved cleaning, transforming, querying and analysing data, before displaying and visualising it in an interactive dashboard. More focused on experimenting and displaying Power BI functionality, rather than extracting real-world insights from the data.

## Tools Used
- Kaggle (for original data set)
- Power BI Desktop
- Power BI Service

## Approach/Steps Taken:
- Downloaded 3 x data sets from Kaggle, imported into Power BI Desktop
- Transformed and cleaned each table. Correcting data types, grouping by fields, adding custom columns and DAX
- Loaded and created relationships in Model View between Year and Country fields
- Created new measures for elements like temperature variance, earliest/latest year, temperature of earliest/last year etc.
- Produced all visualisations, based on Global Temperatures, Temperature by Country, Temperature by Major City
- Applied filters where appropriate, formatted, and published

## Key Visualisations
1. Cards: Ave temp in 1850; ave temp in 2015; % increase; actual celsius increase
2. Line graphs: six major cities displayed showing upward trend in average temperature across time period
3. Bar chart: Top 10 countries with the greatest variance/increase of ave temp over time
4. Scatter chart:
